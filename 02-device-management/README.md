# Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, portfolio-friendly overview of the JumpCloud implementation:
design intent, scoping model, naming standards, and validation criteria.

---

## Contents
- `architecture.md` — high-level architecture and control flow
- `scoping-model.md` — how groups/device groups are used for targeting
- `naming-standards.md` — consistent naming conventions
- `validation-checklist.md` — what “done” means (proof of enforcement)
- `security-redaction.md` — what is sanitized and why

---

## Design principles
- Group-based scoping for consistent enforcement and lifecycle management
- Least privilege mindset (admin vs standard user separation)
- Evidence demonstrates enforcement, not UI navigation

---

## Result
Clear documentation that explains what is implemented and how it is validated.
