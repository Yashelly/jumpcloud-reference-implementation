# JumpCloud Portfolio: Directory, Device Management, SSO/SAML & MFA

This repository is part of my professional portfolio. It documents a practical JumpCloud implementation focused on identity, endpoint management and access controls, with evidence of scoping and enforcement.

## Scope
- Directory fundamentals: users, groups and password policy enforcement
- Windows device management: agent enrollment, device groups and policy scoping
- Access controls: MFA enforcement and SSO (SAML) application integration
- Operations: audit logs, reporting and troubleshooting notes

## Repository structure
- `00-overview/` — design approach, scoping model, naming standards and validation checklist
- `01-directory/` — users, groups, password policy
- `02-device-management/` — Windows enrollment and device grouping
- `03-policies/` — policy scoping and baseline controls
- `04-sso/` — SSO/SAML application integration
- `05-mfa/` — MFA enforcement controls
- `06-operations/` — logs, reporting, troubleshooting

## Evidence standard
Evidence is intentionally minimal and focuses on:
- **scope/targeting**
- **control configuration**
- **validation (success)**

All screenshots/artifacts are sanitized to remove PII and secrets.
See `00-overview/security-redaction.md` (if present).

## Result
A group-scoped JumpCloud configuration demonstrating practical capability across directory, devices, and access controls.
